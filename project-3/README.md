📌 Insurance Cost Prediction
This project compares the performance of Linear Regression and kNN Regression models for predicting insurance costs.

📂 Dataset File: Data/insurance.csv

Features: Age, gender, BMI, number of children, smoking status, region, insurance cost (target)

🔍 Model Comparison

Dataset	Best Model
Original Data	kNN
Data with Outliers Removed	Linear Regression
Data Filled with Mean Values	Equal Performance
Data Filled with Median Values	kNN

📊 Results

kNN is resilient to outliers and captures non-linear relationships well.
Linear Regression performs better on clean and linear datasets.
